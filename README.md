# üìñ How to use
This guide shows you how to use UPTIMESPY!

## üîß Lets go!
```bash
git install https://github.com/vin-ll/uptimespy.git

cd uptimespy
```

You successfully installed uptimespy. Lets install the node dependencies!

```bash
npm install
npm install -g pm2
```

Wow that was easy! (Not fast :P)

Now we want to run everything
```bash
pm2 start npm -- run server --name UPTIMESPY_BACKEND
pm2 start npm -- run checker  --name UPTIMESPY_CHECKER
pm2 start npm -- run frontend --name UPTIMESPY_FRONTEND 
```

pm2 makes everything run in the background so we dont have to run it everytime we use it :P.

NOTE: THIS MAKES THE FRONTEND RUN IN DEVELOPMENT MODE IF YOU WANT TO RUN IT IN PRODUCTION MODE (way more stable) RUN NPM RUN BUILD AND SETUP NGINX WITH IT (development is totally fine though)
